<h1> Tacitus User's Guide</h1>
<p>
Tacitus consists of three views (Home, List and Network).  The Home view allows you to create and open new projects, stage node information to be added, and view documents.  The List view displays all nodes in lists organized by node type.  It also allows you to interrogate the relationships between nodes (i.e. links). The Network view displays the project data as a node/link network map. Here you can add nodes (with the node information staged in the Home view), create links between nodes, delete nodes or links, and manipulate how the nodes are organized on the map.
